aS'Long ago in the massive lands of India, there used to be a village called Gokul. The village of Gokul had a wise and an honest man, Kamat, as its Sarpanch. After many years of service, Kamat realized that he had grown old. It was the time to retire and pass on his responsibilities to someone, who had the potential, mind and passion to manage the village. He and his close committee of advisers searched and searched for the ideal caretaker. Sometimes, when you keep on looking for the solution everywhere, you forget to look around your immediate environment. The person was right in Kamats house, his Son.'
